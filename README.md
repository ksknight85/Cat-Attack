# Cat Attack!
It's well known that the internet is powered by cat memes/gifs. But finding the best cat gif out there? That's the challenge. We developed an app that allows users to essentially play March Madness with cat gifs to determine their favorites. Passport authentication allows users to sign-up/log-in and save their favorite gifs. Users can also add new cat gifs to the tournament.
